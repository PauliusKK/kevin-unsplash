// TODO

-- when you scroll down, load more images. Google how to do that, but I think measuring the body height, and using an event handler to catch when user goes to the end is what would work.

-- sutvarkyti "any" types.

-- add loader

-- add lint

-- add infinite scrolling / loading

-- add BEM

-- add unit tests with Jest or Enzyme

-- add save from Redux store to localstorage then rehydrade on load.

-- add small animations

-- add custom webpack config
