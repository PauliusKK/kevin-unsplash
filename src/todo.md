// TODO

-- when you scroll down, load more images. Google how to do that, but I think measuring the body height, and using an event handler to catch when user goes to the end is what would work.

-- sutvarkyti "any" types.

-- add loader

-- add infinite scrolling / loading

-- add BEM

-- add unit tests with Jest or Enzyme

-- add small animations

-- add custom webpack config

-- add 404 or <NoMatch> in <Router>

-- MAKE IT RESPONSIVE!
